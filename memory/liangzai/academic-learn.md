### 1. CLEF HIPE-2026: Evaluating Accurate and Efficient Person-Place Relation Extraction from Multilingual Historical Texts
- **arXiv**: 2602.17663
- **Authors**: Juri Opitz et al.
- **Abstract**: HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Extends toward semantic relation extraction by targeting person-place associations in multiple languages and time periods. Introduces three-fold evaluation profile: accuracy, computational efficiency, and domain generalization.
